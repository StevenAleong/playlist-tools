        <h2>Information about this tool</h2>
        <p>
            This app was created because I wanted to learn how to use different web technologies and also hoping to make it faster than the original version found at
            <a href="https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer" target="_blank">https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer</a>.
            This tool was built using VueJS and styled with TailWindCSS.

            I didn't do the mobile responsiveness yet so it wont look great on that.

            I didn't build this app to sell. I built this because I wanted to create a new version of my original shuffler. 
            I got asked once by someone if they could send some money to me which I honestly never expected. 
            I just wanted to share the tool that was originally created. 
            I'm just happy people are using the tools and are letting me know! 
            Sorry about the ads on the page, they are there to attempt to help with the hosting costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always love hearing from the people who are using it and just like seeing the messages left but if you're 
            still feeling generous, please buy me a donut or a coffee. Always a surprise and is appreciated.
